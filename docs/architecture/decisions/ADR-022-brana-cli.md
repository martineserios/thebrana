# ADR-022: Brana CLI — Standalone Terminal Interface

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** accepted
**Related:** ADR-003 (agent execution), t-424 (spike), t-426 (scheduler viz), t-427 (Rust evaluation), t-428 (implementation)

## Context

Brana's operational tools are currently accessible only through:
1. **Claude Code plugin** — `/brana:backlog status`, `/brana:build`, etc. (requires an active Claude session)
2. **Raw scripts** — `jq` pipelines on tasks.json, `systemctl --user` for scheduler, manual log hunting

This creates two gaps:
- **No terminal-native access.** Checking task status or scheduler health requires opening Claude Code. A quick `brana tasks next` from any terminal should be possible.
- **Script fragility.** Ad-hoc `jq` chains break silently, have no error handling, and can't render themed output.

The t-424 spike evaluated CLI frameworks and concluded with a hybrid architecture decision.

## Decision

Build a standalone CLI (`brana`) using **Python (typer + rich)** as the primary surface.

### Architecture: Python + Bash (Rust deferred to t-427)

| Layer | Language | Role | Examples |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| **CLI surface** | Python (typer) | Subcommand dispatch, arg parsing, interactive prompts | `brana tasks query`, `brana sched status` |
| **Rendering** | Python (rich) | Themed terminal output — tables, trees, progress bars | Theme system via `themes.json` |
| **Glue** | Bash (existing) | Bootstrap, scheduler runner, cf-env — stays untouched | `bootstrap.sh`, `brana-scheduler-runner.sh` |

> **Note:** Rust hot-path binaries were considered (t-427) but deferred. Tasks.json is <500KB — Python parsing is fast enough. If profiling later reveals bottlenecks, Rust can be added surgically without architectural changes.

### Command groups

```
brana tasks {query,search,status,next,focus,blocked,stale,burndown,diff,context,graph}
brana sched {status,logs,run,history,collisions,enable,disable,drift,health}
brana version
brana doctor
```

**v1 launch set** (ship first, expand later): `tasks status`, `tasks next`, `tasks query`, `sched status`, `sched health`, `doctor`, `version`.

**Scheduler writes exception:** `sched enable`, `sched disable`, and `sched run` mutate system state (systemd units, job execution). These are explicitly allowed because managing systemd from inside Claude Code is awkward and there is no skill equivalent.

### Deep backlog integration

The CLI shares the same data model and rendering logic as `/brana:backlog`:
- **Same theme system** — reads `~/.claude/tasks-config.json`, renders with classic/emoji/minimal icons
- **Same data sources** — `.claude/tasks.json`, `~/.claude/tasks-portfolio.json`
- **Same filtering logic** — status classification, blocked_by resolution, priority sorting
- **Same display conventions** — task-line template, tree connectors, wide mode

The CLI is a read-only terminal mirror of `/brana:backlog`. Writes still go through the skill (which has hooks, validation, GitHub sync).

### Entry point

```toml
[project.scripts]
brana = "system.cli.main:app"
```

Installed via `uv pip install -e .` in the thebrana repo, or `uv run brana` for dev.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Terminal-native access to tasks and scheduler without Claude Code session
- **Positive:** Themed output reuses existing backlog rendering conventions — one visual language
- **Positive:** Python gives fast iteration; Rust can be added later if profiling justifies (t-427)
- **Positive:** `brana doctor` provides system health checks (ruflo, systemd, tasks.json validity, duplicate IDs)
- **Positive:** Shell completions via `typer --install-completion` for free
- **Negative:** New dependency (typer, rich) in the system — but both are mature, well-maintained
- **Negative:** Read-only constraint means most write operations still require Claude Code (exception: sched enable/disable/run)
- **Risk (mitigated):** Theme rendering could drift between SKILL.md and Python. Fix: canonical `system/cli/themes.json` is the single source of truth. SKILL.md references it; `theme.py` loads it at runtime.

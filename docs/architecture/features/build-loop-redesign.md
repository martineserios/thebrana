# Feature: Build Loop Redesign

**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Status:** specifying
**Task:** t-214

## Problem

Brana has 42 skills with 7 touching the build lifecycle (`/build-feature`, `/back-propagate`, `/brana:reconcile`, `/decide`, `/brana:challenge`, `/debrief`, `/brana:maintain-specs`). Users must know which to invoke and when. The 7-phase `/build-feature` is heavy for small changes. `/back-propagate` was designed for a two-repo world that no longer exists (ADR-006 merged enter into thebrana). No industry tool requires 7 phases — the effective pattern is 4 steps.

Beyond the build flow, the full 42-skill surface has redundancies: `/pickup` duplicates what `session-start.sh` could do, `/debrief` and `/brana:retrospective` and `/session-handoff` all store learnings, 12 venture skills serve a solo founder, and documentation exists only for developers — not for users.

## Decision Record (frozen 2026-03-07)

> Do not modify after acceptance.

**Context:** Research on efficient development workflows (Shape Up, SDD paper arXiv:2602.00180, Addy Osmani's LLM workflow, GitHub Spec Kit, Martin Fowler's SDD analysis, inner/outer loop patterns) shows that effective AI-assisted development follows a 4-step inner loop: specify → plan → build → close. Brana's current build flow maps to this but with unnecessary fragmentation across 7 commands.

Challenger review (Opus adversarial) identified:
- C1: Retiring back-propagate ignores 6 proven count-drift incidents → resolved by eliminating hardcoded counts from docs (fix the root cause, not the symptom) and keeping validate.sh as a structural linter
- C2: Merging ADR + feature brief loses archival property → resolved by frozen "Decision Record" section within the feature spec
- W1: Adaptive sizing heuristics are vague → resolved by concrete rules (file count, scope clarity)
- W2: Auto-storing all research creates noise → resolved by two-tier storage (low-confidence with TTL for intermediate, promoted for findings that survive into spec)
- W3: Reconcile demoted to lint loses remediation → resolved by keeping reconcile as on-demand skill
- W4: Challenge absorbed into SPECIFY loses context isolation → resolved by still spawning separate challenger agent

**Decision:**
1. Replace 7 build commands with one `/brana:build` command using a 4-step loop
2. Simplify 42 skills to ~25 by merging redundancies and retiring unused commands
3. Add 7 work-type strategies that adapt the loop (feature, bug fix, greenfield, refactor, spike, migration, investigation)
4. Integrate `/brana:backlog start` as the entry point to `/brana:build` for code tasks
5. Create two documentation trees: user guides (`docs/guide/`) and contributor docs (`docs/architecture/`)
6. Retire `/back-propagate` and `verify-counts.sh` — fix root cause (no hardcoded counts in prose)
7. Embed documentation as a mandatory CLOSE step — shipped without both docs means not shipped

**Consequences:**
- Easier: one command (`/brana:build`) replaces 7, with automatic strategy detection
- Easier: users have a guide that explains workflows, not just skill implementations
- Easier: `/brana:backlog start` flows directly into building — no gap
- Harder: migration from 42 to 25 skills requires careful phasing
- Risk: auto-detection misclassifies work type — mitigated by mandatory confirmation step

## Constraints

- Must preserve TDD enforcement (PreToolUse hook on feat/* branches)
- Must preserve git discipline (branching, worktrees, --no-ff)
- Must work without ruflo (graceful degradation to auto memory)
- Must not break existing projects that reference current skill names
- Documentation is a build deliverable, not optional

## Scope (v1)

### The Build Loop

One command: `/brana:build "description"`

**Step 0: CLASSIFY** (mandatory, one interaction)
- Auto-detect work type from description + task metadata (if started via `/brana:backlog start`)
- Present classification for user confirmation
- Mid-stream reclassification allowed at any point

**7 strategies:**

| Strategy | Steps | Trigger |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Feature | SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD → CLOSE | Default, stream: roadmap |
| Bug fix | REPRODUCE → DIAGNOSE → FIX → CLOSE | "fix/broken/crash/bug", stream: bugs |
| Greenfield | ONBOARD → SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD → CLOSE | "start/new/create project" |
| Refactor | SPECIFY (light) → VERIFY COVERAGE → BUILD → CLOSE | "refactor/clean/restructure", stream: tech-debt |
| Spike | QUESTION → EXPERIMENT → ANSWER | "can we/test if/try/spike", stream: experiments |
| Migration | SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD (parallel) → CLOSE | "migrate/switch/move/upgrade" |
| Investigation | SYMPTOMS → INVESTIGATE → REPORT | "why/investigate/understand", stream: research |

**SPECIFY** (interactive, open-ended — feature, greenfield, migration, refactor):
- Research loop: knowledge base → project docs → cross-client patterns → web
- Present findings, discuss with user — user controls pace
- Scout agents run web research in parallel while discussing
- Auto-store findings in ruflo (confidence: 0.3, ttl: 30d — ages out if not promoted)
- User signal ("draft it", "ready", "let's spec this") moves to draft
- At draft: auto-suggest dimension doc updates, write feature spec (includes Documentation Plan section with user guide, tech doc, and existing-docs-to-update checkboxes)
- Challenger review: spawned as separate agent (context isolation preserved)
- Findings that survive into final spec promoted to confidence: 0.6 (permanent)

**PLAN** (feature, greenfield, migration):
- Break spec into ordered tasks with acceptance criteria
- **Include documentation tasks** — user guide, tech doc, and existing-doc updates are mandatory in the task breakdown (not deferred to CLOSE)
- GitHub Issues if available, otherwise tasks.json entries
- Identify dependencies

**BUILD** (all strategies except spike and investigation):
- Branch (from task convention: feat/, fix/, refactor/)
- For each task: write failing test → implement → verify → commit
- Doc updates in same commit as code changes
- Mini-debrief after each task (what surprised, what to remember)

**REPRODUCE** (bug fix only):
- User describes symptom
- Find the failing case
- Write a failing test that reproduces it (TDD: test IS the spec)
- Confirm: test fails as expected

**DIAGNOSE** (bug fix only):
- Read the code path
- Identify root cause
- Present diagnosis to user for confirmation

**FIX** (bug fix only):
- Implement the fix
- Run failing test → should pass
- Run full test suite → no regressions
- Commit: fix(scope): description

**VERIFY COVERAGE** (refactor only):
- Run existing tests — all must pass
- If coverage gaps: write tests first
- Establish baseline: "N tests pass before refactor"

**QUESTION** (spike only):
- What are we trying to learn?
- What would yes/no look like?
- Timebox

**EXPERIMENT** (spike only):
- Quick prototype in /tmp/ or scratch directory
- No tests, no spec, no branch discipline
- Focus on answering the question

**ANSWER** (spike only):
- Did it work? Store finding via /brana:retrospective
- If yes → leads to /brana:build (feature) with validated approach
- If no → documented dead end
- Delete throwaway code

**SYMPTOMS** (investigation only):
- Describe what's happening
- Gather evidence: logs, errors, reproduction steps
- Form hypotheses

**INVESTIGATE** (investigation only):
- Test hypotheses one by one
- Read code, run experiments, check data
- No code changes — read-only

**REPORT** (investigation only):
- Root cause or candidates
- Recommended action: fix, refactor, accept, defer
- Store findings via /brana:retrospective
- If fix needed → leads to /brana:build --fix

**CLOSE** (all strategies except spike and investigation):
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Retrospective: what errors/re-approaches happened? What to remember?
- Store learnings (ruflo, confidence: 0.5)
- Update feature spec status → shipped (contributor doc)
- Write/update user guide (user doc)
- Update task status → completed (if started via /brana:backlog start)
- Merge (present command, don't auto-execute)

### /brana:backlog start integration

When `/brana:backlog start <id>` is invoked on a task with `execution: code`:
1. Read task metadata (subject, stream, tags, description, context)
2. Auto-classify from stream + description
3. Confirm classification with user
4. Create branch from task convention
5. Enter `/brana:build` with task context pre-loaded
6. `/brana:build` CLOSE updates task status → completed

Tasks with `execution: manual` or `execution: external` just get status updated — no build loop.

### Hooks and rules

| Hook/Rule | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| `session-start.sh` | Absorbs pickup logic (read session-handoff.md) + venture detection (absorbs session-start-venture.sh) |
| `session-start-venture.sh` | Retired — merged into session-start.sh |
| `pre-tool-use.sh` | Unchanged — TDD gate preserved |
| `post-tool-use.sh` | Unchanged |
| `session-end.sh` | Unchanged |
| `rules/sdd-tdd.md` | Unchanged — TDD discipline preserved |
| `rules/delegation-routing.md` | Updated — new command names, simplified trigger table |
| `rules/task-convention.md` | Updated — /brana:backlog start → /brana:build integration |
| `validate.sh` | Keep. Trim instruction density heuristic. |
| `verify-counts.sh` | Delete. Remove hardcoded counts from docs. |

## Deferred

- `/brana:log review` — show last 7 days, promote entries to tasks (v1.1)
- `/brana:log search` — keyword search (grep works for v1)
- Auto-generated command index from SKILL.md frontmatter
- Multi-agent build (parallel task execution via agent teams)
- Domain-Driven Design enforcement (docs/domain/ opt-in, per doc 32)

## Research

Key findings from the SPECIFY research loop:

**SDD paper (arXiv 2602.00180, Jan 2026):** Three levels — spec-first, spec-anchored, spec-as-source. Brana targets spec-first for features, with the frozen Decision Record providing spec-anchored archival.

**Addy Osmani (LLM workflow, 2026):** Spec.md first, break into sequential prompt plans, execute one by one. "Treat AI as a pair programmer that needs clear direction." Validates the SPECIFY → PLAN → BUILD approach.

**Martin Fowler (SDD analysis, Aug 2025):** SDD works well for larger features and greenfield but is overhead for small fixes. AI still drifts from specs mid-stream. Validates adaptive sizing — bug fixes skip SPECIFY.

**GitHub Spec Kit:** `/specify → /plan → /brana:backlog → code`. Open source, MIT. Validates the 4-step loop. Their format influenced the feature spec format.

**Shape Up (Basecamp):** Fixed time, variable scope. No backlog. Cooldown periods. Relevant for rhythm but brana keeps its backlog (tasks.json) — the solo developer context is different from a team.

**Inner/outer loop pattern:** Inner = code/test/debug (fast). Outer = branch/PR/merge (slower). The build loop IS the inner loop. Session flow IS the outer loop.

**Challenger (Opus adversarial, 2026-03-07):** 2 critical findings (count-drift, ADR archival), 4 warnings (sizing, noise, reconcile, challenge isolation). All addressed — see Decision Record.

├── Recall patterns from ruflo
├── Read session-handoff.md (absorbs /pickup)
├── Detect venture project (absorbs session-start-venture.sh)
└── Present context

/brana:backlog start <id> (entry point for code tasks)

### Migration path

Phase 1: Build the new `/brana:build` skill (SKILL.md)
Phase 2: Merge session hooks (session-start absorbs pickup + venture detection)
Phase 3: Rename `/session-handoff` to `/brana:close`, absorb `/debrief`
Phase 4: Merge project/venture onboard and align
Phase 5: Merge venture review skills into `/brana:review`
Phase 6: Restructure docs/ (guide/ + architecture/ split)
Phase 7: Retire old skills, update delegation-routing
Phase 8: Remove hardcoded counts from all docs, delete verify-counts.sh

## Challenger findings

See Decision Record for the full list. Key resolutions:
- Count drift → eliminate hardcoded counts (root cause fix)
- ADR archival → frozen Decision Record section in feature spec
- Auto-detect misclassification → mandatory confirmation step
- Research noise → two-tier storage with TTL
- Challenge context isolation → still spawns separate agent

## Open questions

- Should `/brana:build` auto-commit tasks.json changes or require explicit `/brana:backlog done`?
- Should the feature spec format be enforced by validate.sh (check for required sections)?
- How to handle interrupted builds — `/brana:build` started but session ended before CLOSE?
- Should mid-stream reclassification reset to step 0 or continue from current position?

# 25 - Self-Documentation: Keeping the Spec Repo Alive

How to make a specification repo self-describing, staleness-resistant, and navigable — by humans and AI agents alike. Research synthesis, concrete mechanisms, and what to skip.

---

## The Problem

This repo is unusual: the documents ARE the system. There is no separate codebase that the docs describe — the specs are the primary artifact that the brana system will be built from. When a spec goes stale, the system gets built wrong. When cross-references break, decisions get lost.

Interconnected markdown files (numbered 00-39) maintained by one person with AI assistance. No documentation team. No wiki platform. No Confluence. Just git and markdown.

The question is not "how to write good docs" — it's how to build structural mechanisms that make staleness visible, cross-references checkable, and trust levels explicit.

---

## Core Principle: Documentation Quality = Agent Performance

This is not a metaphor. Anthropic's internal teams found that Claude Code performance improves proportionally to CLAUDE.md quality. Vercel's evals proved it empirically: CLAUDE.md achieves 100% pass rate vs 53% for skill invocation on always-needed knowledge.

For brana, this means the spec repo is operational infrastructure. A stale spec about hook events (doc 24 caught the Stop vs SessionEnd mismatch) doesn't just confuse a reader — it causes Claude to implement the wrong hook.

**The only reliable anti-rot mechanism is structural, not motivational.** "Everyone should keep docs updated" never works. What works: CI checks, dependency tracking, visible staleness indicators, and reviews tied to implementation milestones rather than calendar dates.

---

## Mechanism 1: YAML Frontmatter

Every document gets a machine-readable header. This is the single highest-leverage change — low effort, unlocks everything else.

### Schema

```yaml
---
id: 25
title: Self-Documentation
layer: dimension          # dimension | reflection | roadmap
status: accepted          # proposed | accepted | superseded | deprecated
growth_stage: budding     # seedling | budding | evergreen
last_reviewed: 2026-02-10
depends_on: []            # doc IDs this one builds on
depended_by: []           # doc IDs that build on this one
superseded_by: null       # doc ID if replaced
diataxis_type: explanation  # tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation
---
```

### Field Definitions

**layer** — Where this doc sits in the propagation hierarchy. Changes to a dimension doc should trigger review of reflection docs. Changes to a reflection doc should trigger review of roadmap docs. (See [MEMORY.md document layers](../README.md) for the full rules.)

**status** — Lifecycle state:
- `proposed`: draft, not yet validated. Don't build on this.
- `accepted`: reviewed, settled. Safe to depend on.
- `superseded`: replaced by another doc. `superseded_by` points to the replacement.
- `deprecated`: no longer relevant. Keep for historical context but don't follow.

**growth_stage** — Maturity indicator (from Maggie Appleton's digital garden pattern):
- `seedling`: early exploration, may be wrong. Treat as speculative.
- `budding`: shaped but evolving. Use with caution, expect revisions.
- `evergreen`: settled decision. Safe to depend on, rarely changes.

This is a trust signal for AI agents: a `growth_stage: seedling` tells Claude to treat content as speculative, while `evergreen` means firm decision.

**depends_on / depended_by** — Explicit dependency graph. Must be symmetric: if doc 17 depends on doc 14, then doc 14's `depended_by` must include 17. A validation script enforces this.

**diataxis_type** — Which of the four documentation types this doc primarily serves (Daniele Procida's Diataxis framework). Almost all current docs are `explanation`. This field exists to surface gaps — when implementation starts, the repo will need `how-to` and `reference` docs too.

### What Frontmatter Enables

| Frontmatter Field | What It Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `depends_on` / `depended_by` | Auto-generated dependency graph, PR impact analysis |
| `last_reviewed` | Staleness detection with per-layer thresholds |
| `status` | Filter out superseded/deprecated docs from active reading |
| `growth_stage` | AI agents know how much to trust each doc |
| `layer` | Automated upward propagation reminders |
| `diataxis_type` | Gap analysis — what doc types are missing? |

---

## Mechanism 2: Staleness Detection

### The Staleness Gradient

Not all documents rot at the same rate. The staleness gradient, from fastest to slowest:

1. **Specific model/API references** — model names, parameter defaults, API endpoints
2. **External tool versions** — claude-flow features, Claude Code hook events
3. **Quantitative claims** — token costs, rate limits, benchmarks
4. **Cross-references between documents** — as docs evolve independently, refs drift
5. **Architecture decisions** — the most stable. "Use quarantine as first immune layer" won't go stale

### Layer-Aware Thresholds

Different document layers need different review cadences:

| Layer | Threshold | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Roadmap (17, 18, 19, 24) | 30 days | Implementation details change fast |
| Reflection (08, 14, 29, 31, 32) | 90 days | Architecture decisions are more stable |
| Dimension (01-07, 09-13, 15-16, 20-23, 25-28, 33-37) | 180 days | Research and analysis are the most durable |

**Implementation:** `scripts/staleness-report.sh` — checks git last-modified per doc against layer thresholds (Phase 1: age check) and flags docs whose dependencies updated more recently (Phase 2: dependency freshness). Two-tier output: WARN at 80% of threshold, STALE past threshold. Runs weekly via `brana-scheduler` with output stored in claude-flow memory (`namespace: scheduler-runs`).

### Version-Pinned Package Tracking

The fastest-rotting content is external tool versions (#2 on the staleness gradient). Each dimension doc's **Refresh Targets** section includes a `**Versions:**` table that pins the version of every external package the doc references:

```markdown
**Versions:**
| Package | Pinned | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| claude-flow | v3.1.0-alpha.44 | https://www.npmjs.com/package/claude-flow |
| agentdb | v3.0.0-alpha.3 | https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentdb |
| agentic-flow | v2.0.7 | https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentic-flow |
```

When `/refresh-knowledge` runs, agents compare pinned versions against the latest from each Source URL. Version deltas are the highest-priority output — a breaking change in claude-flow is more urgent than a new blog post. After applying updates, the Versions table is updated to the new baseline. Packages pinned as "—" get their first version filled on the first refresh cycle.

### Dependency-Triggered Reviews

Age isn't the only trigger. If doc A depends on doc B, and B was updated more recently than A was last reviewed, flag A for review even if it hasn't hit its age threshold.

This catches the most dangerous failure mode: a dimension doc changes, but the reflection and roadmap docs that depend on it don't get updated. Doc 24 (roadmap corrections) exists because exactly this happened — specs referenced incorrect concepts that had changed upstream.

### Tie Reviews to Implementation Milestones

The only review cadence that actually works: review docs when you start implementing from them.

- Start Phase 1 → review docs 04-07, 09, 11 (the dimension docs that inform it)
- Complete Phase 2 → update docs 17, 18 (the roadmap docs that describe it)
- Find an error during implementation → add to doc 24 (errata)

Calendar-based "quarterly review" cycles are too infrequent and disconnected from reality. By the time you review, the damage is done.

## Mechanism 3: CI/CD for Documentation

### Fast Checks on Every Push (~30 seconds)

| Check | Tool | What It Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown structure | markdownlint-cli2 | Heading hierarchy, list style, formatting inconsistency |
| Internal links | lychee (local only) | Broken links when files are renamed or deleted |
| Cross-references | Custom script | "doc 99" references to nonexistent files |
| Terminology | Vale + custom style | "reasoning bank" instead of "ReasoningBank" |

### PR-Time Analysis

**Impact analysis**: "You changed `14-mastermind-architecture.md`. These docs depend on it: 17, 18. Please review them."

Built from the frontmatter `depends_on` / `depended_by` fields. A script parses changed files, walks the dependency graph, and comments on the PR.

### Scheduled Checks (Weekly)

| Check | What It Does |
|---|---|
| External link check | lychee (full) — catches dead URLs that break randomly |
| Staleness report | Flags docs past their layer threshold |
| Dependency freshness | Flags docs whose dependencies were updated more recently |
| Frontmatter validation | Checks symmetry of `depends_on`/`depended_by`, missing fields |

### Tool Configuration

**markdownlint** — spec-friendly config:
- Allow long lines (tables, URLs)
- Allow multiple H1s (each doc has its own title)
- Allow trailing punctuation in headings (questions in specs)
- Enforce consistent heading style (ATX) and list markers (dash)

**lychee** — link checker:
- Check local file links and fragment anchors
- Accept common redirect status codes (301, 302)
- Separate external URL checks to weekly schedule (too flaky for push)

**Vale** — prose linter with custom `brana` terminology:
```yaml
# Enforce consistent terms
swap:
  reasoning bank: ReasoningBank
  Reasoning Bank: ReasoningBank
  claude flow: claude-flow
  Claude Flow: claude-flow
  sona: SONA
  session end: SessionEnd
  session start: SessionStart
```

## Mechanism 4: Auto-Generated Indexes

### The Problem with Manual Indexes

README.md and MEMORY.md are manually maintained indexes of the spec documents. Every time a doc is added, renamed, or changes status, both indexes must be updated by hand. This is itself a staleness vector — the index drifts from reality.

### What to Generate

**README.md document table** — generated from frontmatter. Each row shows: filename, title, layer badge, growth stage, status. Replaces the current manual table.

**Mermaid dependency graph** — generated from `depends_on` fields. Embedded in README.md between markers so it auto-updates:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Dimension
        D01[01 System Analysis]
        D02[02 Nexeye Skills]
        D04[04 Claude 4.6]
        D09[09 Native Features]
        D16[16 Knowledge Health]
    end
    subgraph Reflection
        D08[08 Diagnosis]
        D14[14 Mastermind]
    end
    subgraph Roadmap
        D17[17 Full Roadmap]
        D18[18 Lean Roadmap]
        D24[24 Corrections]
    end
    D01 --> D08
    D02 --> D08
    D08 --> D14
    D09 --> D14
    D14 --> D17
    D16 --> D17
    D17 --> D18
    D17 --> D24
```

**MEMORY.md document map** — the document list section can be generated from frontmatter rather than maintained by hand. Other sections (key findings, architecture summaries) remain manual since they capture compressed insight, not just metadata.

### Generation Pattern

Scripts read all `*.md` files, parse YAML frontmatter, and write output between `<!-- START -->` / `<!-- END -->` comment markers. This is the Simon Willison pattern: metadata lives in the files, rendered views are generated by scripts. The script is idempotent — run it any time, get the current state.

---

## Mechanism 5: Cross-Reference Hygiene

### The Current State

The repo has two kinds of cross-references:

1. **Formal markdown links**: `[16-knowledge-health.md](./16-knowledge-health.md)` — machine-checkable
2. **Informal prose references**: "doc 16", "per doc 12 quarantine rules" — human-readable but invisible to link checkers

About half the references are informal. These are the most fragile: if a document is renamed or its sections reorganize, the prose reference silently breaks.

### The Fix

**Convert informal references to formal links.** Every "see doc 16" should become `[doc 16](./16-knowledge-health.md)`. This is a one-time cleanup that makes the entire collection machine-checkable via lychee.

**Add a cross-reference validation script** that:
1. Extracts all `doc NN` prose references (regex: `doc\s+\d+`)
2. Verifies the file `NN-*.md` exists
3. Reports orphan documents (docs not referenced by any other doc)
4. Reports broken prose references

**Add explicit cross-reference sections** to each document. Following Andy Matuschak's "dense linking" principle — every doc should declare what it relates to:

```markdown
## Cross-References

- [08-diagnosis.md](./08-diagnosis.md) — keep/drop/defer decisions this doc supports
- [17-implementation-roadmap.md](./17-implementation-roadmap.md) — Phase 2 testing methodology
- [16-knowledge-health.md](./16-knowledge-health.md) — staleness detection for patterns maps to staleness detection for docs
```

---

## Mechanism 6: Growth Stages as Trust Signals

### Why This Matters for AI Agents

When Claude reads the spec documents to build the brana system, it needs to know which documents to trust fully and which to treat as exploratory. Without explicit maturity markers, Claude treats all documents equally — even early-stage research that may have been superseded.

### Stage Definitions

**Seedling** — Early exploration. May be incomplete, speculative, or wrong.
- The doc captures initial research or a preliminary idea
- Don't build on it without verifying against other sources
- Expected to change significantly
- *Current example: none (all docs have passed this stage)*

**Budding** — Shaped but still evolving. Has substance but hasn't been battle-tested.
- The doc has been through discussion and revision
- Core ideas are sound but details may shift during implementation
- Safe to reference, but check before depending on specifics
- *Current examples: docs 17, 18, 19 (roadmaps and PM design — will evolve during implementation)*

**Evergreen** — Settled decision. Rarely changes. Safe to depend on.
- The doc has been validated through implementation experience or through cross-referencing multiple research sources
- Core findings are stable. Only details (version numbers, tool names) may need updating
- *Current examples: docs 01-03 (current system analysis — facts about what exists), doc 08 (diagnosis — decisions are made)*

### Promotion Criteria

- **Seedling → Budding**: doc has been reviewed, cross-referenced with other docs, and the core ideas survive
- **Budding → Evergreen**: doc has been validated through implementation or its claims are confirmed by multiple independent sources

Demotion also happens: an `evergreen` doc can regress to `budding` if implementation reveals its assumptions were wrong. This is the spaced-repetition insight from Andy Matuschak — documents you actively reference during implementation stay fresh; documents you don't touch silently rot.

### Swyx's Learning Gears as a Lens

The growth stages map to Swyx's Learning Gears framework:
- **Explorer gear** (seedling) — covering ground fast, raw notes, high speed, many directions
- **Connector gear** (budding) — linking ideas, building frameworks, structured analysis
- **Mining gear** (evergreen) — deep architectural work, settled conclusions

This repo's natural evolution: docs 01-03 were Explorer output, docs 04-13 were Connector output, docs 14-19 are Mining output.

---

## Mechanism 7: Documentation Locality — Don't Split Docs Across the Repo

### The Sprawl Problem

A spec repo with dozens of documents has a natural tendency to grow satellite files: README.md indexes, MEMORY.md summaries, CLAUDE.md instructions, frontmatter schemas, validation scripts, generated graphs. Each new meta-artifact creates a maintenance surface that duplicates information from the source docs.

The brana ecosystem already has five places where doc-like content lives:
1. **This repo** (`enter/`) — the spec documents (source of truth)
2. **MEMORY.md** (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`) — compressed summaries for agent recall
3. **README.md** — human-readable index and dependency graph
4. **CLAUDE.md** (project-level) — instructions for agents working in this repo
5. **thebrana/** — the implementation repo, which starts accumulating its own docs

Every time a spec changes, the question is: how many of these other locations need updating? If the answer is "more than one," the system has a locality problem.

### The Rule: One Fact, One Location, Zero Manual Copies

Martraire's *Living Documentation* principle: **knowledge should live on the thing it describes.** For a spec repo this means:

- **Spec content lives in the numbered doc files.** Period. No substantive claims in README.md, no architectural decisions in MEMORY.md, no design rationale in CLAUDE.md.
- **README.md is a generated view.** It should contain only: a brief purpose statement, a generated doc table, a generated dependency graph, and a generated decision index. All generated from frontmatter. If README.md requires manual editing beyond the purpose statement, something is wrong.
- **MEMORY.md is a lossy cache.** It compresses spec content for agent context windows. It's allowed to be stale — agents should follow links to source docs for decisions. Never add information to MEMORY.md that doesn't exist in a source doc.
- **CLAUDE.md is behavioral instructions.** It tells agents HOW to work with the repo, not WHAT the specs say. "When adding new docs, update README.md" is correct. "The system uses three trust tiers" is not — that belongs in doc 12.

### Specific Anti-Patterns

**The Summary Creep.** MEMORY.md starts as a brief index, then grows paragraphs of architectural summaries. Now there are two places describing the mastermind architecture: docs 14/31/32 and MEMORY.md. When a reflection doc changes, MEMORY.md drifts silently.

*Fix:* MEMORY.md summaries should be one-liners with links. Deep content stays in source docs. Treat MEMORY.md like a database index — it helps you find things, it doesn't replace them.

**The Shadow Spec.** A PR adds a `docs/` directory or `ADR/` folder inside the implementation repo. Now specs live in two places. Which one is authoritative?

*Fix:* One repo for specs, one for code. The code repo's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` references the spec repo. It never duplicates spec content. If a spec needs to be close to the code it describes, that's a signal the spec should graduate into the code repo's own docs — but then it leaves the spec repo (move, don't copy).

**The Meta-Doc Spiral.** A doc about how to write docs (this one). A doc about how to review docs. A doc about the doc validation pipeline. A doc about the doc generation scripts. Each meta-doc adds maintenance burden without adding spec content.

*Fix:* Cap meta-docs at one (this document). Validation and generation details belong in script comments or a short section in CLAUDE.md, not in dedicated spec documents. This doc is already at the limit — resist creating doc 26 about "documentation workflow."

**The Cross-Repo Reference.** Spec docs reference thebrana/ implementation details. Implementation docs reference spec doc numbers. Now changes in either repo can silently break the other.

*Fix:* Specs reference concepts, not file paths. "The session-start hook should recall patterns" not "see `thebrana/system/hooks/session-start.sh` line 30." Implementation references to specs should use stable doc IDs (`per spec 14`) not file paths that could rename.

### Locality Checklist

When adding any new file to the repo, ask:

1. **Does this fact already live somewhere?** If yes, link to it instead of restating it.
2. **Is this generated or manual?** If it can be generated from frontmatter, it should be. Manual indexes rot.
3. **Will two places need updating when this changes?** If yes, you've created a duplication. Eliminate one copy.
4. **Does this belong in this repo?** Implementation details belong in the implementation repo. Process docs belong in CLAUDE.md. Only research, analysis, and architectural decisions belong here.

### Research Sources for Locality

- Martraire, *Living Documentation*: "the ideal number of places where a piece of knowledge is recorded is exactly one"
- DRY applied to documentation: Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham's original insight was about knowledge duplication, not just code duplication
- Google's documentation model: docs live next to the code they describe, in the same repository, reviewed in the same PRs
- Diátaxis: each doc type has one home — don't scatter tutorials across README, wiki, and blog posts
- The Wikipedia model: articles are self-contained; disambiguation pages link but don't duplicate

## What NOT to Do

Research surfaced many approaches that are wrong for this specific repo. Capturing them explicitly so they don't get re-evaluated later.

| Temptation | Why Skip | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Reorganize into atomic Zettelkasten notes | 30 thematic docs is the right granularity for specs. Zettelkasten IDs add noise. | Matuschak's own notes show the pattern is for personal thinking, not team/AI docs |
| Adopt Obsidian/wiki tooling | Git-native is the right home. Tools that need their own editor fragment the workflow. | The repo is already markdown + git. Adding a tool adds a dependency. |
| Full literate programming (tangle/weave) | No code to tangle. The specs describe a system that doesn't exist as code yet. | Revisit when thebrana/ has real code and specs can generate configs from prose. |
| SemVer per document | Too much maintenance for a collection this interconnected. Docs move together, not independently. | Use git tags for collection milestones instead (`specs-v1.0`). |
| Quarterly review cycles | Too infrequent. By the time you review, the spec is already harmful. | Tie reviews to implementation milestones, not calendar dates. |
| AI-generated documentation | Creates docs that read well but may contain hallucinations. | Use AI to check docs (consistency linting), not to write them. |
| Full Diataxis reorganization | This repo is 90% Explanation type. That's correct for a spec repo. | Use Diataxis as a diagnostic lens, not a reorganization mandate. |
| Duplicate information in multiple places | MEMORY.md, README.md, and doc content should not repeat the same facts manually. | Generate indexes from frontmatter to maintain single source of truth. |
| Scatter docs across directories/repos | `docs/`, `ADR/`, `specs/` subdirectories fragment the collection and make staleness invisible. | Flat directory, numbered files, one repo. See Mechanism 7. |
| Create meta-docs beyond this one | Docs about doc workflow, doc tooling, doc review process. Each adds maintenance without spec content. | One meta-doc (this). Process details in CLAUDE.md or script comments. |

## Decision Index Pattern

### The Gap

Decisions are scattered across 30 documents. When a future reader asks "why did we choose quarantine over deletion for bad patterns?" they must search through doc 16 to find the reasoning. There's no central list of decisions.

### The Solution

A decision index that extracts key decisions from all docs into a navigable list. Not a separate document — a generated section in README.md:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Made In | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Drop custom skill routing — Claude 4.6 reasons about skills directly | [doc 08](./08-diagnosis.md) | accepted |
| ReasoningBank is the #1 value-add over native capabilities | [doc 08](./08-diagnosis.md) | accepted |
| Three trust tiers for skills: local, catalog, discovery | [doc 12](./12-skill-selector.md) | accepted |
| Quarantine over deletion for bad patterns | [doc 16](./16-knowledge-health.md) | accepted |
| Three critical hooks: SessionStart, SessionEnd, PostToolUse | [doc 14](./14-mastermind-architecture.md) | accepted (corrected in doc 24) |
| Start with lean roadmap, use full roadmap as reference | [doc 18](./18-lean-roadmap.md) | proposed |
```

This is the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) pattern applied without restructuring. Existing documents stay as they are. The index just makes decisions findable.

### Extraction Method

Each document should mark its key decisions with a consistent pattern (a heading like `## Key Decisions` or `## Decisions`). The generation script extracts these sections and compiles the index. Until that's automated, the index can be maintained manually as a section in README.md.

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Immediate (do before Phase 1 of implementation)

1. **Add YAML frontmatter** to all 30 documents — `id`, `title`, `layer`, `status`, `growth_stage`, `last_reviewed`, `depends_on`, `depended_by`
2. **Convert informal cross-references** — replace "doc NN" prose with `[doc NN](./NN-filename.md)` links
3. **Add lychee to CI** — single GitHub Action, catches broken links on push, zero maintenance
4. **Write frontmatter validation script** — check symmetric dependencies, missing fields

### Phase 2: During implementation

5. **Add markdownlint** with spec-friendly config
6. **Add Vale** with custom `brana` terminology style
7. **Write impact analysis script** — on PR, report dependent docs that need review
8. **Auto-generate Mermaid dependency graph** in README.md
9. ~~**Add staleness check** with per-layer thresholds~~ — **implemented** as `scripts/staleness-report.sh` (2026-02-19). Scheduled weekly via `brana-scheduler`.

### Phase 3: When the collection stabilizes

10. **Auto-generate README.md document table** from frontmatter
11. **Create decision index** — initially manual, then auto-extracted from doc sections
12. **Build LLM consistency checker** — a Claude Code skill that compares key claims across related docs for contradictions

## All Commands

The brana system has skills across code-focused and venture/business categories, plus agents (scout, memory-curator, project-scanner, venture-scanner, challenger, debrief-analyst, archiver, daily-ops, metrics-collector, pipeline-tracker). Commands are organized in four categories, all invoked via `/command-name` in a session. Skills and agents integrate via four patterns documented in [14-mastermind-architecture.md](./14-mastermind-architecture.md).

### Spec Maintenance

Commands for keeping the spec repo healthy. These operate on documents.

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **`/maintain-specs`** | Full correction cycle: apply errata → re-evaluate reflections → deepen → check doc 25 → update memory → surface findings | **After `/debrief`, or when you suspect doc drift** |
| `/refresh-knowledge` | Web search for external updates to dimension and venture/PM docs (10 topic groups, including Group J: docs 19, 28, 29, 34) | Before `/maintain-specs` when external tools may have changed |
| `/research` | Atomic research primitive: topic, doc, creator, or leads — recursive discovery with source registry | **Ad-hoc research** or called by `/refresh-knowledge` per doc. See [33-research-methodology.md](./33-research-methodology.md) |
| `/re-evaluate-reflections` | Cross-check dimension vs reflection docs | When you only want to check, not fix |
| `/apply-errata` | Apply pending fixes from doc 24, layer by layer | When you already have errata and just want to apply them |
| `/back-propagate` | Reverse flow: implementation change → identify affected spec docs → update dimension/reflection/roadmap | **After adding/changing a rule, hook, skill, or config** — closes the implementation→spec gap |
| `/reconcile` | Detect drift between enter specs and thebrana implementation, plan fixes, apply after approval | **After `/maintain-specs`** when impl-relevant specs changed, or periodically to check for accumulated drift |
| `/repo-cleanup` | Commit accumulated spec doc changes with proper branching | When modified files have built up across sessions |

### Knowledge Management

Commands for the learning loop. These operate on the pattern memory (claude-flow DB).

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/memory recall` | Search learned patterns, grouped by confidence tier (proven/quarantined/suspect) | **Start of work** — "what do I already know about this?" |
| `/retrospective` | Store a learning + review recalled patterns (promote useful, demote harmful) | **End of work** — "what did I learn this session?" |
| `/memory pollinate` | Pull transferable patterns from other projects | **When stuck** — "did another project solve this?" |
| `/project-onboard` | Bootstrap a new code project: scan structure, recall relevant patterns, suggest CLAUDE.md | **Once per project** — first session in a new codebase |
| `/project-align` | Active alignment pipeline: assess gaps → plan → implement structure → verify → document | **After `/project-onboard`** identifies gaps, or when setting up a new project |
| `/project-retire` | Archive a project's patterns, keep transferable ones active | **Once per project** — when a project is done |
| `/memory review` | Monthly ReasoningBank health check: stats, staleness, promotion candidates | **Monthly** or when curious about knowledge health |
| `/session-handoff` | Auto-detect close/pickup mode. Close: debrief-analyst → store learnings as quarantined patterns (retrospective) → graduation suggestions → doc drift heuristic → handoff note → claude-flow store. Pickup: read handoff → reconcile cross-session changes → surface flags + correction patterns | **Session start or end** — auto-detects which mode based on git activity |

### Implementation & Quality

Commands for building and reviewing.

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/build-phase` | Implement next roadmap phase with scaffolding gates + learning loops. Build loop: plan → implement → autonomous fix (2 attempts before escalate) → verify (before/after state check) → commit → mini-debrief | When ready to build the next phase |
| `/build-feature` | Guide a feature from zero to shipped in 7 phases (orient, discover, shape, design, plan, build, close). Build loop: plan what you'll change and why → implement → autonomous fix on failure → verify before/after state → commit → mini-debrief with before/after check | **When building a new feature, capability, or deliverable in any project** — not for brana's own roadmap (use `/build-phase`) or business milestones (use `/venture-phase`) |
| `/debrief` | Extract errata, fixes, and process learnings from a session | **End of implementation sessions** |
| `/challenge` | Spawn an Opus subagent to stress-test a plan or decision. Empty invocation self-challenges the last answer | **Before committing to a big decision**, or after any answer to stress-test it |
| `/decide` | Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/decisions/` | **Before implementing a significant decision** — captures context, decision, consequences |
| `/usage-stats` | Token usage analytics — model distribution, activity trends, session efficiency | **When checking usage patterns** or evaluating model routing efficiency |
| `/tasks` | Plan, track, and execute tasks — hierarchy (phase > milestone > task), streams, tags, context, branch integration, agent execution via subagents | **When planning phases, viewing roadmaps, or executing task waves** — 13 subcommands including `execute`, `tags`, and `context` |
| `/scheduler` | Manage systemd-timer scheduled jobs — status, enable/disable, logs, manual runs. Thin wrapper over `brana-scheduler` CLI | **When managing scheduled background jobs** — see [ADR-002](./docs/decisions/ADR-002-scheduler-thin-layer-over-systemd.md) |
| `/respondio-prompts` | Respond.io AI agent prompt engineering — write instructions, actions, KB files, multi-agent architectures within platform constraints | **When writing or reviewing Respond.io agent prompts**, designing multi-agent handoff flows, or creating knowledge bases |
| `/pdf` | Convert markdown to PDF using md-to-pdf — consistent A4 format, clean styling | **When exporting proposals, docs, or reports to PDF** — produces client-ready output |

### Business & Venture Management

Commands for non-code project management. These operate on business project structure and knowledge. See [28-startup-smb-management.md](./28-startup-smb-management.md) for the research and [29-venture-management-reflection.md](./29-venture-management-reflection.md) for the architecture rationale.

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/venture-onboard` | Diagnostic: stage classification, framework recommendation, gap report | **First session on a business project** — the business equivalent of `/project-onboard` |
| `/venture-align` | Active setup: stage-appropriate templates, SOPs, OKRs, metrics, meeting cadences | **After `/venture-onboard`** identifies gaps — the business equivalent of `/project-align` |
| `/venture-phase` | Plan and execute a business milestone (launch, hiring, fundraise, expansion, process overhaul) | **When executing a specific business milestone** — the business equivalent of `/build-phase` |
| `/sop` | Create a structured, versioned Standard Operating Procedure | **When a repeatable process needs documenting** — the business equivalent of writing a spec |
| `/growth-check` | AARRR funnel analysis + stage-appropriate metrics health check | **Monthly/quarterly** or when something feels wrong — the business equivalent of running tests |
| `/morning` | Daily operational check: focus card, priorities, blockers, key metric. Step 3d shows personal tasks if `~/enter_thebrana/personal/` exists | **Daily** — start of work session on a business project |
| `/weekly-review` | Weekly cadence review: portfolio health, metrics delta, ship log, next-week planning. Step 1c shows life area ratings if `~/enter_thebrana/personal/` exists | **Weekly** — end of work week |
| `/personal-check` | Personal life check: tasks, life areas, journal freshness. Read-only focus card from `~/enter_thebrana/personal/` | **Daily** — personal priorities and life area health |
| `/monthly-close` | Monthly financial close: P&L summary, actuals vs projections, trend analysis, runway | **Monthly** — financial close and business review |
| `/monthly-plan` | Forward-looking monthly plan: revenue targets, priorities, experiments, pipeline actions | **Monthly** — after `/monthly-close`, planning next month |
| `/pipeline` | Sales pipeline tracking: leads, deals, conversions, follow-ups | **Ongoing** — when managing sales activity |
| `/experiment` | Growth experiment loop: hypothesis, test design, success criteria, results, learning | **When testing a growth hypothesis** |
| `/content-plan` | Marketing content planning: themes, calendar, distribution, performance tracking | **Quarterly** — content strategy planning |
| `/financial-model` | Revenue projections, scenario analysis, P&L template, unit economics | **When building or updating financial projections** |
| `/gsheets` | Google Sheets operations via MCP: read, write, create, list, share | **When working with spreadsheet data** — batch operations, range queries |

### When to Use What — The Workflow Map

Commands fit into natural moments in your work. You don't need all of them every session — use what the moment calls for.

**Starting a new code project:**
```
/project-onboard
```

Example: You clone a new Next.js + Supabase project. `/project-onboard` scans `package.json`, detects the stack, and recalls patterns from other projects that used the same tech:

```
Tech stack detected: Next.js 14, Supabase, TypeScript, Tailwind
Relevant patterns found:
  - [nexeye] Supabase auth: use server-side client in middleware, not client-side
    (confidence: 0.8, transferable, from 4 recalls)
  - [nexeye] Next.js: put shared types in /types, not /lib/types
    (confidence: 0.5, quarantined)
Suggested: creating .claude/CLAUDE.md with these conventions...
```

---

**Starting a session (any project):**
```
/memory recall [topic]
```
Optional. Most useful when starting a new task or returning to a topic after a gap. The session-start hook already auto-recalls project patterns, but `/memory recall` lets you search for specific topics.

Example — about to work on hook testing:
```
/memory recall hook testing
```
```
## Proven patterns (confidence >= 0.7)
- [brana] Hook testing requires full pipeline simulation — bash -n
  catches syntax but not logic. Pipe real JSON, verify side effects.
  (confidence: 0.8, recalls: 4, source: brana)

## Quarantined patterns (confidence < 0.7)
- [brana] memory search preview truncates stored JSON — use memory
  retrieve for field-level verification.
  (confidence: 0.5, recalls: 1, source: brana)

## Suspect patterns (confidence < 0.2)
  (none)
```

Example — broad recall before starting work:
```
/memory recall supabase auth
```

---

**Making a significant decision:**
```
/decide [title]
```
Creates an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `docs/decisions/`. Auto-increments the number, stores in ReasoningBank. Works for both code decisions ("use JWT for auth") and business decisions ("hire a COO before a CTO").

Example:
```
/decide use PostgreSQL over MongoDB for user data
```
```
Created: docs/decisions/ADR-003-use-postgresql-over-mongodb-for-user-data.md
Status: proposed
Next: Fill in Context, Decision, and Consequences sections.
```

---

**Aligning a project with brana practices:**
```
/project-align
```
The active version of `/project-onboard`. Runs a 28-item checklist, identifies gaps, and creates the missing structure: CLAUDE.md, rules, docs/decisions/, test framework, domain glossary. Works in tiers (Minimal/Standard/Full) — the user picks.

---

**Planning and building:**
```
/build-phase           (brana's own roadmap phases)
/build-feature [desc]  (any feature in any project)
/challenge [plan]      (adversarial review — or empty to self-challenge last answer)
```
`/build-phase` plans, implements, debriefs, and maintains specs in one cycle — specifically for brana's roadmap. `/build-feature` is the general-purpose equivalent: it guides any feature from zero to shipped in 7 phases (orient, discover, shape, design, plan, build, close), spawning scout, memory-curator, challenger, and debrief-analyst agents at appropriate stages. Creates feature briefs in `docs/features/`, ADRs when `docs/decisions/` exists, and GitHub Issues when available. `/challenge` is surgical — provide a plan to stress-test, or invoke empty to self-challenge the last answer.

Example — stress-testing a migration plan:
```
/challenge We're planning to move from REST to tRPC across 40 endpoints.
  The plan is to migrate one router at a time over 3 sprints.
```
Spawns an Opus subagent that might respond:
```
Pre-mortem: This migration failed 3 months in. What went wrong?

1. Sprint 2 stalled because shared middleware (auth, rate limiting)
   assumed REST request shape. tRPC procedures don't carry headers
   the same way. You'd need to migrate middleware FIRST, not per-router.

2. The 40 endpoints have 12 consumer apps. Without a compatibility
   layer, migrating one router breaks consumers that mix old/new calls.

Suggestion: Migrate middleware → add dual-mode adapter → then routers.
```

---

**After notable work (something learned, something broke):**
```
/retrospective [learning]
```
This is the **most important knowledge command**. Every learning you store starts at `confidence: 0.5` (quarantined). As you recall and validate it across sessions, `/retrospective` promotes it. Without this, the knowledge system accumulates data but never builds trust.

Example — you just discovered that `npx` is unreliable in hook subprocesses:
```
/retrospective npx downloads packages on every call when run from $HOME
  because there's no local node_modules. Use direct binary path instead.
```
```
Stored pattern:
  key: pattern:brana:npx-unreliable-in-hooks
  confidence: 0.5 (quarantined)
  transferable: false
  tags: project:brana, tech:nodejs, type:hooks, outcome:failure

Reviewing recalled patterns from this session...
  - "Hook testing requires full pipeline simulation" was recalled
    and was useful this session. recall_count: 3 → 4.
    Promoting to confidence: 0.8, transferable: true ✓
  - No harmful patterns to demote.
```

Example — just a quick learning, no argument:
```
/retrospective
> What did you learn?
Supabase RLS policies silently return empty rows instead of 403 errors.
  Always check .error AND .data.length to detect permission failures.
```

---

**End of implementation sessions:**
```
/debrief
/maintain-specs
```
`/debrief` captures what went wrong (errata) and what you learned (lessons). `/maintain-specs` propagates those findings into the spec docs. Together they close the feedback loop.

Example — after a Phase 2 implementation session:
```
/debrief
```
```
## Debrief Complete
### Errata documented: 2
- Error #17: memory search preview truncates stored JSON values
- Error #18: memory retrieve requires --namespace flag
### Learnings documented: 1
- search is for discovery, retrieve is for verification
### Stored in claude-flow: 3 entries
### Follow-up: Run /maintain-specs to propagate findings
```
```
/maintain-specs
```
```
## Spec Maintenance Report
### Step 1: Re-evaluate Reflections
- Doc 14: 1 gap found — Context7/claude-flow conflation. Fixed.
### Step 2: Apply Errata
- Error #19 applied (doc 14 table row split)
### Step 3: Doc 25
- Doc 25 current.
### Summary: 1 error applied, 2 docs modified
```

---

**When stuck on a problem:**
```
/memory pollinate [topic]
```
Searches for transferable patterns across all projects. Only shows patterns with `transferable: true` or high confidence.

Example — struggling with test reliability in a new project:
```
/memory pollinate flaky tests
```
```
Found 2 transferable patterns from other projects:

[brana] ((var++)) under set -e exits when var is 0
  Bash arithmetic post-increment returns the old value. Under set -e,
  a 0 result means exit code 1 → script dies silently.
  Fix: use VAR=$((VAR + 1)) instead.
  (confidence: 0.8, source: brana, validated 3x)

[nexeye] Supabase test isolation: each test needs its own anon key
  Shared auth state between tests causes order-dependent failures.
  Fix: create fresh Supabase client per test suite.
  (confidence: 0.7, source: nexeye, validated 3x)

Note: cross-pollinated patterns should be validated in your project
context before trusting them.
```

---

**Retiring a project:**
```
/project-retire [project-name]
```

Example:
```
/project-retire nexeye
```
```
Found 12 patterns for nexeye:
  - 3 high-confidence + transferable → keeping active
    (Supabase auth middleware, RLS empty-row gotcha, test isolation)
  - 5 high-confidence + project-specific → archived
  - 4 low-confidence → archived
Updated portfolio.md: nexeye marked as retired.
```

---

**Starting a new business project:**
```
/venture-onboard
```
The business equivalent of `/project-onboard`. Classifies the business stage (Discovery/Validation/Growth/Scale), recommends frameworks (Lean Startup, EOS, OKRs, Scaling Up), and identifies gaps.

Example:
```
/venture-onboard
```
```
## Venture Onboard: Acme SaaS

Stage: Validation
Domain: SaaS (B2B)
Team size: 4

Recommended Framework: Lean Startup + light OKRs (1-2 objectives max)

Gaps (prioritized):
Critical:
  - No decision log (docs/decisions/)
  - No metrics tracking
Important:
  - No CLAUDE.md with business context
  - No experiment tracking

Suggested: Run /venture-align to implement the recommended structure
```

---

**Setting up business management structure:**
```
/venture-align
```
The business equivalent of `/project-align`. Creates stage-appropriate templates: CLAUDE.md with business context, decision log, metrics framework, meeting cadence, OKR templates, SOP directory. Runs a stage-aware checklist and shows before/after scores.

---

**Executing a business milestone:**
```
/venture-phase [type]
```
The business equivalent of `/build-phase`. Plans and executes a business milestone with learning loops. Five built-in milestone types: product launch, hiring round, fundraise, market expansion, process overhaul. Each generates stage-appropriate work items with exit criteria.

Example:
```
/venture-phase hiring
```
```
## Milestone: Hiring Round

Work Items:
| # | Item | Exit Criteria |
| 1 | Role definition | Job spec in docs/ |
| 2 | Job description | JD created |
| 3 | Sourcing strategy | Strategy documented |
| 4 | Interview process | SOP created via /sop |
| 5 | Onboarding SOP | SOP created via /sop |

Approve this plan? [y/n]
```

---

**Documenting a repeatable business process:**
```
/sop [process name]
```
Creates a structured, versioned SOP in `docs/sops/SOP-NNN-slug.md`. Interviews the user about the process, then produces a template with: purpose, owner, trigger, steps with decision points, exit criteria, common issues, metrics. Auto-increments the SOP number (same pattern as `/decide`).

Example:
```
/sop customer onboarding
```
```
Created: docs/sops/SOP-001-customer-onboarding.md
Owner: Customer Success
Trigger: New customer signs contract
Steps: 8 (including 2 decision points)
Next review: 6 months
```

---

**Checking business health:**
```
/growth-check
```
The business equivalent of running tests. Detects business model type (subscription, cycle-project, marketplace, consulting, service) and selects appropriate metrics. Audits stage-appropriate metrics against benchmarks, runs AARRR funnel analysis to identify the bottleneck, checks founder leverage for small teams (<40% on unique work = red), and compares against previous snapshots for trend tracking.

Example:
```
/growth-check
```
```
## Growth Check: Acme SaaS

Stage: Growth

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Status |
| MRR | $45K | Growing | 🟢 |
| LTV:CAC | 2.1:1 | 3:1+ | 🟡 |
| Monthly churn | 8% | <5% | 🔴 |

AARRR Bottleneck: Retention — churn is the constraint.
  Fix retention before investing more in acquisition.

Trend vs last check: MRR ↑12%, churn → (flat), LTV:CAC ↓
```

---

**Continuing a previous session:**
```
/session-handoff
```
Reads the handoff note left by the previous session, reconciles any cross-session changes, and picks up where the last session left off.

### The Confidence Lifecycle

This is the core loop that `/retrospective` and `/memory recall` drive:

```
New learning ──→ confidence: 0.5 (quarantined)
                      │
              recalled + useful (3x)
                      │
                      ▼
              confidence: 0.8 (proven, transferable)
                      │
              /memory pollinate can share it
                      │
                      ▼
              other projects benefit

    recalled + harmful ──→ confidence: 0.1 (suspect)
```

Hooks handle the plumbing (auto-recall at session start, auto-store at session end). Skills handle the judgment (was this useful? should it be promoted?). **The hooks can't promote — only `/retrospective` can**, because promotion requires your judgment about whether a pattern was actually useful.

### Command Architecture

Three orchestrators (brana roadmap, any-project features, business milestones), shared learning loop. No circular follow-ups.

  │
  ├── Step 0: Orient — locate repos, check clean state, create branch
  │
  ├── Step 1: Scan specs — extract concrete claims about thebrana

  │
  ├── Step 7: Store in ReasoningBank — run metadata for future recall

Trigger: /maintain-specs suggests /reconcile when impl-relevant specs change.
The two commands form a pair: /maintain-specs cascades within specs,
/reconcile pushes spec changes into implementation.

  │            reflection, and roadmap docs cover it
  │
  ├── Step 3: Update dimension docs (the source of truth)
  │            — add tool/practice/decision to the relevant

  │
  └── Step 7: Report what was updated

Worst case: nothing changed anywhere → clean "all specs current" report.

INTEGRATION POINTS
──────────────────
Commands that should suggest /back-propagate:

  /debrief     → when findings include implementation changes
                  (rules added, hooks modified, skills created)
  /project-align → after creating structure (rules, configs)
                  that represents decisions not yet in specs
  /venture-align → after creating SOPs, OKRs, templates
                  that encode domain decisions
  /build-phase → after any work item changes implementation
                  in ways the specs didn't anticipate

Commands that should suggest /reconcile:

  /maintain-specs → when cascaded changes touch impl-relevant specs
                    (skills, hooks, rules, agents, config, deploy)

Commands that should suggest /maintain-specs (existing, unchanged):

  /debrief     → when findings include spec-level errata
  /refresh-knowledge → after discovering external changes

CROSS-POLLINATION (the differentiator)
══════════════════════════════════════
Code and business patterns live in the same ReasoningBank.
/memory pollinate surfaces insights across both domains.
/retrospective stores learnings from any session type.
```

**Why `/refresh-knowledge` is separate:** It runs web searches across all dimension docs — expensive and slow. The rest of the cycle works purely from local docs and is fast. Run `/refresh-knowledge` when you suspect external tools or platforms have changed, then `/maintain-specs` to propagate.

### Recommended Workflow

**Regular maintenance:**
```
/maintain-specs
```
That's it. Re-evaluates, applies fixes, checks doc 25, updates memory, asks about storing findings. Exits early at every step if nothing needs doing.

**After a long gap or major external changes:**
```
/refresh-knowledge     ← check external world first
[update stale dimension docs manually]
/maintain-specs        ← propagate through all layers
```
